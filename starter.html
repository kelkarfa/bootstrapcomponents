        <h2>
          The Space Race was an informal competition between the United States
          and the Soviet Union to see who could make the furthest advancements
          into space first. It involved the efforts to explore outer space with
          artificial satellites, to send man into space, and to land him on the
          Moon.

              the 1960s, the Space Race continued apace through the U.S. Apollo
              moon landing of 1969. Although they followed Apollo 11 with five
              more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to
              new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was
              intended to return spaceships intact from space journeys.
